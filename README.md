# Mortgage Calculator 📊

<p>I was approached by a client through <b>Fiverr</b> to develop a <b>Mortgage Calculator</b></p>
<p>Leveraging React and Tailwind CSS, I crafted an intuitive and responsive user interface for the calculator.</p>
<p>The calculator incorporates essential mortgage calculations, such as monthly payments, total interest, and amortization schedules, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of their financial commitment.</p>
<p>Additionally, I integrated interactive charts to visualize the loan amortization and payment breakdown, enhancing the user experience.</p>
<p>This project showcases my expertise in web development with React and my ability to create practical financial tools that offer valuable insights to users.</p>
